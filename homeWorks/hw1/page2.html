                    John Backus was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1924.<br></br>
                    He received an M.S. in mathematics from Columbia University (1950).<br></br>
                    Backus interviewed at IBM and was hired to work on programming their<br></br>
                    new computer systems.By 1953, he was leading a small team to create<br></br>
                    an easy-to-use programming language for scientific users.<br></br>

                    FORTRAN was the world's first high-level programming language.<br></br>
                    It was developed at IBM by a small team led by John Backus.<br></br>
                    The earliest version of FORTRAN was released in 1957 as a<br></br>
                    programming tool for the IBM 704. Fifty years later, FORTRAN<br></br>
                    remains the programming language of choice for large-scale<br></br>
                    numerical calculations in science and engineering.
