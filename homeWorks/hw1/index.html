                    Ada Lovelace (December 10, 1815 to November 27, 1852) was a <br>
                    British mathematician and computer engineer who improved upon the<br>
                    designs of Charles Babbage.Her work is considered to be the first<br>
                    written computer algorithm in that it contain written instructions<br>
                    for a machine to follow.She became an important factor in the work<br>
                    of Charles Babbage,inventor of the famed, Difference Engine, the<br>
                    early precursor to the calculator that was based on a finite number<br>
                    of possible calculations.

                    Alan Turing was born on 23 June 1912 in Maida Vale, London.<br>
                    Alan Turing was an English mathematician and pioneer of theoretical<br>
                    computer science and artificial intelligence.During WW2, he was<br>
                    instrumental in breaking the German Enigma code, leading to Allied<br> 
                    victory over Nazi Germany.

                    Alonzo Church was born June 14, 1903, Washington, D.C., Hudson,<br>
                    Ohio, and a U.S. mathematician. He earned a Ph.D. from Princeton<br>
                    University. His contributions to number theory and the theories<br>
                    of algorithms and computability laid the foundations of computer<br> 
                    science.The rule known as Church’s theorem or Church’s thesis<br>
                    (proposed independently by Alan M. Turing) states that only<br>
                    recursive functions can be calculated mechanically and implies<br>
                    that arithmetic procedures cannot be used to decide the consistency<br>
                    of statements formulated in accordance with the laws of arithmetic.<br>
                    He wrote the standard textbook Introduction to Mathematical Logic<br>
                    (1956) and helped found the Journal of Symbolic Logic, which he<br>
                    edited until 1979.
