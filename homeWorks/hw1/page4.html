                <strong>Alan Jay Perlis</strong>, born in April 1, 1922 – February 7, 1990,<br>
                was an American computer scientist known for his work in <br>
                programming languages and the first to receive the Turing<br>
                Award.He was awarded the Turing Award in 1966 for his influence<br>
                in the area of advanced programming techniques and compiler<br>
                construction. This is due to the work he had done as a member<br>
                of the team that developed the ALGOL programming language.

                <strong>Algebraic Oriented Language, Algorithmic Language(ALGOL)</strong>,<br />
                ALGOL had recursive subprograms—procedures that could invoke<br />
                themselves to solve a problem by reducing it to a smaller<br />
                problem of the same kind. ALGOL introduced block structure,<br />
                in which a program is composed of blocks that might contain<br />
                both data and instructions and have the same structure as an<br />
                entire program. Block structure became a powerful tool for<br />
                building large programs out of small components.
