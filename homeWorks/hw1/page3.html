                she obtained a B.A. in mathematics and physics. She continued her <br />
                education at Yale University by completing a masters and Ph.D. in<br />
                mathematics. She became Director of Automatic programming in 1952<br />
                and subsequently oversaw the company's endeavor to produce<br />
                specifications for a common business language. From 1959 to 1961,<br />
                Hopper lead the team that invented COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language),<br />

                COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language) is a high-level programming language
                for business applications. It was the first popular languaged designed to be 
                operating system agnostic and is still in use in many financial and business 
                applications today.COBOL was designed for finance, human resources and other
                business computer programs. Unlike some high-level computer programming languages,
                COBOL uses English words and phrases to make it easier for ordinary business users
                to understand.
